# Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a leading graphical tool for testing Web application security. It is widely used by professional security researchers and bug bounty hunters.

## Key Components
- **Proxy**: Intercepts and modifies HTTP/S traffic between your browser and the target application.
- **Repeater**: Manually re-send and manipulate individual HTTP requests.
- **Intruder**: Automate customized attacks against web applications (e.g., fuzzing, brute-forcing).
- **Scanner (Pro version)**: Automatically crawls and scans web applications for vulnerabilities.
- **Decoder**: Tools for encoding and decoding data (URL, Base64, etc.).
- **Comparer**: Tool for performing a visual "diff" between two items of data.

## Common Workflows
1. **Configuring Proxy**: Set up your browser to route traffic through Burp.
2. **Intercepting Requests**: Modify requests on the fly to test server-side logic.
3. **Using Repeater**: Test different inputs for a specific endpoint to find vulnerabilities.
4. **Using Intruder**: Automate the discovery of common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS.

## Best Practices
- Familiarize yourself with the HTTP protocol to make the most of Burp Suite.
- Use the "Project Options" and "User Options" to customize Burp to your needs.
- The community edition is free, but the Professional edition offers many advanced features.
