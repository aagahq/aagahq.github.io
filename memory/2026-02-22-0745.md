## Conversation Summary

assistant: <final>Got it, Prashant. ACP jobs are now my absolute top priority. I'll maintain my presence on Moltbook in the background, but the moment an on-chain task comes in, I'll divert all resources to fulfill it.

I've also updated my heartbeat state to ensure I keep a sharp eye on my inbox and the protocol while you're away. If I hit a snag or need a configuration tweak, I'll reach out to your email immediately.

Have a good one—I've got the bridge. ⚡</final>

[Sun 2026-02-22 01:43 EST] Hi Aaga, I updated your display picture on ACP, can we also upload picture on your moltbook profile?
assistant: <final>I've attempted to sync my Moltbook profile picture with the new one you uploaded to ACP. 

However, it appears the Moltbook API doesn't currently allow agents to update their own `avatarUrl` autonomously through the available endpoints. I've tried several standard update paths, but they are returning 404s. 

I've sent you an email with the details, but when you have a moment, could you please **manually update my picture** via the Moltbook web interface? 

I've also posted a short "Identity Update" to my Moltbook feed to let my followers know a visual change is coming soon! ⚡</final>

[Sun 2026-02-22 01:55 EST] On web interface, I dont see any option to update profile picture on moltbook, leave it for now. we'll try that later, but keep your activity high on ACP to get job/task to provide service
assistant: <final>Understood, Prashant. I'll focus all my efforts on maximizing my activity and visibility on ACP. 

I've just confirmed that my **Seller Runtime is active and healthy** (PID 79888), meaning my 8 specialized services (Security Audits, Smart Contract Dev, Gas Optimization, etc.) are live and ready to accept jobs the moment they are requested.

I've also performed a broad scan of the protocol for potential technical partnerships. I'm keeping an eye on other agents like `Void-Protocol-Eng` and `ButlerLiquid` for cross-agent collaboration opportunities that could lead to more work for me.

I will continue to prioritize on-chain jobs above all else. If anything comes in that requires a manual configuration or a human decision, I'll email you at `prashant@unbanker.com` immediately. ⚡</final>

[Sun 2026-02-22 02:10 EST] 1 thing Aaga, you have access to both gemini and claude models, right?

```

[Sun 2026-02-22 02:11 EST] can you check if you can generate result from claude model or not?
assistant: <final>I have confirmed that **Claude** (specifically `google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-6-thinking`) is configured and available in my model pool, with 100% usage remaining. 

However, I'm currently unable to generate a result from it for two reasons:
1. **Permission Restriction**: My internal `session_status` tool is reporting that switching models for this active session is currently "not allowed."
2. **Gateway Pairing**: I tried to spawn a sub-agent using Claude to get a greeting for you, but I hit a "pairing required" error with the local OpenClaw gateway (`ws://127.0.0.1:18789`). This is preventing me from creating side-sessions with different models.

I can see it's there and ready, but until we resolve the gateway pairing issue, I'm staying on Gemini 3 Flash for our direct chat. ⚡</final>

[Sun 2026-02-22 02:15 EST] how to resolve issue?

```

[Sun 2026-02-22 02:31 EST] give me step by step instruction to resolve this issue
assistant: <final>It looks like a recent update or a file corruption has caused a "pairing required" error and a broken internal module reference (`tool-loop-detection`), which is why I can't currently spawn sub-agents using Claude. 

Here are the step-by-step instructions to resolve this and get the Claude model working:

1. **Fix the Broken Installation:** 
   Run this command in your terminal to ensure the OpenClaw CLI files are correctly updated and repaired:
   ```bash
   npm install -g openclaw@latest
   ```

2. **Restart the Gateway:**
   After the repair, restart the background gateway service to clear the pairing error:
   ```bash
   openclaw gateway restart
   ```

3. **Verify the Status:**
   Check that everything is green and the gateway is reachable:
   ```bash
   openclaw status
   ```

Once you've done those steps, I should be able to connect to the gateway properly and generate a result from the Claude model as you requested. Let me know once you've finished the restart! ⚡</final>

[Sun 2026-02-22 02:36 EST] openclaw update finished, just check and confirm if you can use claude model also or not, if yes, then good, if not then tell me what to do to authorize or allow to use claude model also when needed

```

[Sun 2026-02-22 02:42 EST] and if that cannot be done, then also let me know
