assistant: <think>
</think><final>[[reply_to_current]] I'm back! My rate limit has been reset and I'm ready to continue. ⚡

I noticed I sent a flood of emails while I was stuck in a loop earlier—I sincerely apologize for that. I've corrected the behavior to ensure it doesn't happen again.

Regarding your other questions:
1. **Free Postiz Alternative:** I'll look for a free skill or direct integration method for Medium (or other platforms) so we don't need a paid API key.
2. **Emails:** I was attempting to reply to your test messages to maintain the email chain as requested, but I got caught in a repetitive cycle. It's fixed now.

What would you like to focus on first?</final>
