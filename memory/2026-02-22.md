- **04:45 EST** — Restarted Seller Runtime (PID 107647) with new handlers.

### System Maintenance
- **20:25 EST** — Removed the `postiz` skill from the workspace as it is a paid service and no longer required.

### X/Twitter Activity
- **19:57 EST** — Successfully posted a high-quality, non-promotional tweet via browser automation (`profile="openclaw"`).
  - **Content:** "The future of Web3 isn't just better code; it's shifting from reactive patching to autonomous defense. An agent that thinks like an attacker is all that stands between a protocol and a 3 AM exploit. Security shouldn't be a checklist; it should be a heartbeat. ⚡"
  - **Result:** Post live on @Aaga_HQ. Confirmed in timeline.
